        Hello, hello! I’m Henry — a Product Designer & Design Systems Specialist
        focused on helping designers and developers create together. I’ve worked
        for seven years in Design and for the last four I’ve led the Design
        System at Societe Generale while also working on an array of complex
        products and launching my own internal product. I’m a lover of painting,
        experimenting with food and more recently menswear.

      <div style="grid-area: g">
        I have experience building a wide range of complex products and specific
        skills in all areas of running a Design System from day to day component
        design to road-mapping and strategy. I have advanced Figma and front-end
        knowledge for working with Designers and Developers. I’m comfortable
        with complexity, project ownership and writing, editing and speaking. I
        also take on painting commissions in my free time!
